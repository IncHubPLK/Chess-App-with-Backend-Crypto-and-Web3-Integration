# Chess Game with Backend, Crypto Payments, and Machine Learning

This is a web chess game coded in React. Feel free to contribute as this is an open source project!

## How to Play

Click the piece you want to move, and then click the desired destination. Users play against a simple chess engine.

## Features

You play as the white player, and black is controlled by a simple chess AI (implemented using the minimax algorithm). Most of the rules of chess, from castling to not being able to put yourself in check, are fully implemented. Draws and time limits are not enabled. I also implemented time travel, so that users can view previous moves.

## Goals for Next Release

v2.0 The goal of this project is to develop a fully functional chess game with several new features, including player profile management, live player forums & chat, dogecoin crypto gifts, UI/UX update, crypto payment integration for transfer, receiving and gifting, and machine learning capabilities to help teach a play style based on analysis from player games, include past games and existing youtube lessons on chess. The project will be hosted on Github and developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and various backend technologies.

Features:

    Player profile management: This feature will allow players to create and manage their profiles, including their personal information, gameplay statistics, and history of games played.

    Live player forums & chat: This feature will enable players to communicate with each other through live forums and chat rooms.

    Dogecoin crypto gifts: This feature will allow players to gift dogecoin cryptocurrency to each other as a way of appreciating each other's gameplay skills.

    UI/UX update: This feature will update the chess game's user interface and user experience to provide a better playing experience for the users.

    Crypto payment integration: This feature will enable players to transfer, receive, and gift cryptocurrencies like Metamask and Doge as a mode of payment.

    Machine learning capabilities: This feature will use machine learning algorithms to analyze player gameplay styles, including past games and existing youtube lessons on chess, and help teach players how to improve their gameplay skills.

Tools & Technologies: The project will use HTML, CSS, Javascript, Firebase/Google Cloud, Metamask, Doge, and various machine learning libraries and frameworks.

Deliverables: The deliverables for this project will include a fully functional chess game with all the new features mentioned above. The project will be hosted on Github, and the source code will be available for download and use by anyone interested in playing chess or contributing to the project.

Timeline: The project's timeline will depend on the scope and complexity of the features being added. However, a rough estimate would be around 6-8 months.

Budget: The project will be open source, so there won't be any direct costs associated with it. However, there may be costs associated with hosting and using third-party libraries and services.

Conclusion: This project aims to develop a fully functional chess game with several new features, including player profile management, live player forums & chat, dogecoin crypto gifts, UI/UX update, crypto payment integration, and machine learning capabilities to help teach a play style based on analysis from player games, include past games and existing youtube lessons on chess. The project will be hosted on Github and developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and various backend technologies.
